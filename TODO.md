TODO

- Add agent configuration file parsing with an AgentConfig struct
- Wrap `Conn` objects returned by the listener with a type that can be used to determine if they are TLS-terminated or not
- Remove the legacy package by folding all of its logic into the current package
- Add an RPC test
- Implement support for AgentSession.ID()
- Endpoint.ID() should return the endpoint's API resource identifier but right now it just returns a random unique identifier unrelated to the API resource
- Endpoint.Wait() which can be used to wait until an endpoint stops
