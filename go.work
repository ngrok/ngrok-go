// General workspace notes:
// This is mostly here so that gopls/vscode will quit yelling at me. The modules
// seem to work just fine without it. The replace's are duplicated everywhere
// because `go mod tidy` & co seem to ignore the ones at the workspace level.
// See: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50750.
